\title{npi: Access the U.S. National Provider Identifier Registry API}
\description{
Access the United States National Provider Identifier Registry API (if available) and provide informative error messages when it's not.
}
\details{
\pkg{npi} makes it easy to search and work with data from the U.S.
National Provider Identifier (NPI) Registry API (v2.1) directly from R.
Obtain rich administrative data linked to a specific individual or
organizational healthcare provider, or perform advanced searches based on
provider name, location, type of service, credentials, and many other
attributes. npi provides convenience functions for data extraction so you can
spend less time wrangling data and more time putting data to work.

There are three functions you're likely to need from this package. The first
is \code{\link{search_npi}}, which allows you to query the NPI Registry and
returns up to 1,200 full NPI records as a data frame (tibble). Next, you can
use \code{\link{summary.npi_results}} (invoked by \code{summary()}) on
these results to obtain a human-readable summary of each record. Finally,
\code{\link{get_list_col}} extracts and flattens conceptually-related
subsets of data into a tibble that can be joined by the `npi` column into an
analysis-ready object.

  repository, \url{https://www.github.com/frankfarach/npi}. You can customize
  it by setting the \code{npi_user_agent} option:
