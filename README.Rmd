Use R to access the U.S. National Provider Identifier (NPI) Registry API (v2.1) by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS): https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/. Obtain rich administrative data linked to a specific individual or organizational healthcare provider, or perform advanced searches based on provider name, location, type of service, credentials, and many other attributes. `npi` provides convenience functions for data extraction so you can spend less time wrangling data and more time putting data to work.

## Installation

Install `npi` directly from Github using the `devtools` package:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("frankfarach/npi")
library(npi)
```

## Usage

`npi` exports four functions, all of which match the pattern "npi_*":

 * `npi_search()`: Search the NPI Registry and return the response as a [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/) with high-cardinality data organized into list columns.
 * `npi_summarize()`: A method for displaying a nice overview of results from `npi_search()`.
 * `npi_flatten()`: A method for flattening one or more list columns from a search result, joined by NPI number.
 * `npi_is_valid()`: Check the validity of one or more NPI numbers using the official [NPI enumeration standard](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Administrative-Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand/Downloads/NPIcheckdigit.pdf).

### Search the registry

`npi_search()` exposes nearly all of the NPPES API's [search parameters](https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/help-api). Let's say we wanted to find up to 10 organizational providers with primary locations in New York City:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nyc <- npi_search(city = "New York City")
```
```{r print-nyc}
nyc
```

The full search results have four regular vector columns, `npi`, `provider_type`, `created_date`, and `last_updated_date` and seven list columns. Each list column is a collection of related data:

 * `basic`: Basic profile information about the provider
 * `other_names`: Other names used by the provider
 * `identifiers`: Other provider identifiers and credential information
 * `taxonomies`: Service classification and license information
 * `addresses`: Location and mailing address information
 * `practice_locations`: Provider's practice locations
 * `endpoints`: Details about provider's endpoints for health information exchange

If you're comfortable [working with list columns](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html), this may be all you need from the package. But let's not stop just yet, because `npi` provides convenience functions to summarize and extract the data you need.

## Working with search results 

Run `npi_summarize()` on your results to see a more human-readable overview of what we've got:

```{r summarize-nyc}
npi_summarize(nyc)
```

Suppose we just want the basic and taxonomy information for each NPI in the result in a flattened data frame:

```{r flatten-two}
npi_flatten(nyc, c("basic", "taxonomies"))
```

Or we can flatten the whole thing and prune back later:

```{r flatten-all}
npi_flatten(nyc)
```

Now we're ready to do whatever else we need to do with this data. Under the hood, `npi_flatten()` has done a lot of data wrangling for us:

  * unnested the specified list columns
  * avoided potential naming collisions by prefixing the unnested names by their originating column name
  * joined the data together by NPI

### Validating NPIs

Use `npi_is_valid()` to check whether each element of a vector of candidate numbers is a valid NPI number:

```{r valid_npi_ex}
# Validate off NPIs
npi_is_valid(c(1234567893, 1234567898))
```

This function doesn't check whether the NPI numbers are activated or deactivated (see [#22](https://github.com/frankfarach/npi/issues/22#issuecomment-787642817)).

## Set your own user agent

By default, all request headers include a user agent that references this repository. You can customize the user agent by setting the `npi_user_agent` option:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
options(npi_user_agent = "my_awesome_user_agent")
```
