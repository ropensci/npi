## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * `npi_flatten()` is now covered by unit tests (#15 and #73).
  * `npi_search()` provides an informative error message when internet is off or the endpoint is unreachable (#52).
  * `npi_search()` now checks for legal use of special characters prior to submitting an API request (#53).
  * `npi_search()` now checks for legal use of wildcard characters prior to submitting an API request (#54).
  * User agent default now includes the installed package version (e.g., "npi/0.2.0") (#55).
  * `checkmate` package is now in Imports rather than Suggests so tests are run on it (#57).
